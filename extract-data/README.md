# XMT-SDL-MT-data-analysis

These scripts require python3. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install
the requirements.

## Collating required data
Subject data must be placed in the subject data directory. The require files
are:
- ps-data dir - containing statement and method level classes, results and
  analysis dirs generated by the tool.
- assertions_count.txt - containing the number of assertions 
- gregor.xml - the mutants.xml results file produced by Gregor Mutation Engine
  for PIT, renamed to gregor.xml
- hash_count.txt - containing the hashcode for the project

An demo project has been placed in `subject-data` to demonstrate required files,
but must be removed before running scripts as contains no data.

## Running analysis scripts
1. Change directory into `scripts`.
2. Run `python3 read-projects.py`
    This will produce the relevant .csv files containing all the data analysis
    in `output-data`. 

The JaCoCo coverage data was manually extracted from JaCoCo coverage reports and
added to the `.csv` files and table data. 

## Creating the tables and plots used in the paper
To create the tables and figures used in the paper, use the following Jupyter
notebooks found in the main directory.
- `project-characterisation.ipynb`
- `RQ1.ipynb`
- `RQ2and3.ipynb`
These notebooks currently point to the `csv` files provided with the replication
package. To use the data produced from following the above steps, you should
redirect them to those files.
